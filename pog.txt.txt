I’m a young hobbyist from the UK looking to find my entry point into a career in software.

I started working with code by making games at the age of 15 and have slowly built my confidence working predominantly with C#. Recently I have been doing small projects in Python, TypeScript and JavaScript to build a larger catalogue of languages, finding rapid success in quickly adapting to new syntax by analysing documentation and applying functions in a meaningful way to learn from my research.

I’m a natural problem solver.
To me, code has always been 20% bringing an action to fruition and 80% finding how to best make it work. WIth that in mind
