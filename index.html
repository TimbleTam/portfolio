        <br/>
        <h2 class="page-h1-body">I started working with code by making games at the age of 15 and have slowly built my confidence working predominantly with C#. Recently I have been doing small projects in Python, TypeScript and JavaScript to build a larger catalogue of languages, finding rapid success in quickly adapting to new syntax by analysing documentation and applying functions in an effective way to learn from my research.</h2>

        <h2>To me, code has always been 20% bringing an action to fruition and 80% finding how to best make it work.</h2>
        <br/>
        <h2>I have always planned out my code before writing to ensure it works to the best of its ability. Hitting all marks it needs to and making it lightweight and practical for other uses later down the road. I hope to bring this philosophy with me into a career, where I can make meaningful additions to a codebase that positively affect the team and project more as time goes on.</h2>

        <h2>With a Long history in making games, my skill set involves multiple disciplines.</h2>
        <br/>
        <h2>With experience in 3D Modelling and Animation, I am able to rapidly and independently create clean assets and prototypes.</h2>
        <br/>
        <h2>With my countless hours of debugging, I am able to rapidly isolate and correct any problems that come up in code and find better ways to optimise the classes of most resistance.</h2>
        <br/>
        <h2>With my time and practice working in Game Design, Level Design and User Interface Design, I am very capable of planning out and creating prototypes and front-end software with a user-first approach and creating lightweight, powerful and functional code for the back-end and function of the current project.</h2>
        <br/>
        <h2>Working independently on large projects has also taught me how to plan development and organise an efficient workflow to see me through to the next milestone. With these skills under my belt, I believe I would make a valuable member of any team.</h2>
