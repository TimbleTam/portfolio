    "skills-section-1-desc-2": "With javascript I have brought about solutions that are a first in my current industry, engineering solutions that tackle issues in content delivery that haven't been addressed before on the level my code has.",
    "skills-section-1-desc-3": "While I (like many) prefer to use frameworks to build my sites and applications, my fundamental knowledge of these languages is the backbone of my current direction in tech.",

    "skills-section-1-card-1-desc-2": "The goal for Restrntr was to be used to help myself and anyone else eating out with a group decide where to go.

    "skills-section-1-card-2-title": "Melvin",
    "skills-section-1-card-2-desc-1": "Built for the sake of experimentation into LLM's Melvin is a front end interface used to present users with an example of AI role-play in a training scenario.",
    "skills-section-1-card-2-desc-2": "Melvin takes the role of an aggravated customer demanding a refund on an item, with the user tasked with having to use good language and communication to lower Melvin's aggression and convince them to accept another proposal, This is assisted by the presence of an emotional response bar for Melvin, as well as a multi-tiered system of current aggression to further simulate the experience.",

    "skills-section-2-desc-2": "Before getting into the industry I previously had no experience with Vue or other Front End frameworks. But that has changed over time. Now being able to use it as a powerful tool to make fast, beautiful, reactive web apps that have stunned my client-base and required very little QA.",

    "skills-section-2-card-1-title": "Phase 3 Media",
    "skills-section-2-card-1-desc-1": "An early, unfinished personal project for learning vue. Phase-3-Media is intended to be built as a home page for a fictional, small scale videography business with a primary focus around animation and responsive behaviour.",

    "skills-section-3-desc-2": "I have been trying to learn React on the side as my current place of work is preparing to pivot towards using it as our primary Front End framework and have been finding myself surprised by the speed at which I can debug and learn inside of this framework and how much its Object Orientation improves the developer experience.",

From the beginning, the player needed to have as much breathing room as possible to enter a flow state and a high frame rate and comfortable controls were paramount to making this the case. Weeks of planning and hours of code testing have eventually culminated in an experience that lets players feel like the hero Lily is trying to be.",

    "skills-section-5-desc-1": "While I am new to the language, thanks to its simplistic syntax I have made rapid progress learning",
    "skills-section-5-desc-2": "So far with Python I have worked with flask and SQL to develop personal projects and am looking to develop my knowledge further building my current projects further and learn other tools such as mongoDB",
